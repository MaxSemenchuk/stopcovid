## People still working

The psychological health of the people that are not under quarantine and especially those that are still coming into the lab is super important. Everyone is under a lot of strain, and this can start to show in interpersonal relationships at work, in the number of mistakes that people do, etc. Of course, the obvious thing you can do to help is to send the people home. If you are supervising someone who is part of a skeleton crew \(such as the mice facility\) it is important to make sure that you can help this person avoid the external stressors. Help them navigate the daily challenges that may now become additional stressors: stocking up on food, navigating public transport, asking to make sure that their family is OK. You can become an important outlet for these people, which would make sure that coming to work for them would be a way to relieve their stress of the external work. That would work the best if these individuals know that they are coming into an empty and a controlled environment, where they know that they can expect adherence to strict social distancing protocols and restrictions that protect their safety. I think that it is acceptable to adopt such strict measures that are specific to your lab, floor, building \(coordinate with your colleagues\). For these people who absolutely must be at work or the institute collapses make sure that you implement and enforce social distancing protocols. I am sure that this will give a piece of mind to those workers whose work is absolutely essential.

## People under quarantine and positive COVID-19 cases

Those individuals who are under quarantine orders and COVID-19 positive cases are presently the people that may be in need of support. Having said that, for different people support means a different thing. Some people need to talk, some people need to be left alone. Everyone deals with stress and uncertainty in a different way and you need to be sensitive, understanding but also to be able to recognize these different needs. The best way to approach this is to just let the people know that you are always there to talk if they need you. At the same time, be respectful of their privacy, do not be overbearing and do not relate the content of the conversations you have with people who confide in you to others. Make sure you treat more or less any information given to you under these circumstances as confidential. Make sure that everyone in your lab knows how to contact you and that they know that you are open to be contacted should they wish or need to. Those individuals that will be taken to the hospital may require individual attention and you will have to be extra attentive to their needs for social interaction or for privacy.

## People not working but not under quarantine

Those individuals who are not at work but are not under quarantine also need support. It is a hard challenge for them to stay at home, or be in an environment that they perceive as inherently hostile, and it is also hard for you to give them the appropriate support. For those individuals not under strict quarantine it may be beneficial to introduce a routine with long outside excursions in parks and the abundant wilderness around the IST. Those that can leave the house and just go for a walk to the woods should be encouraged to do so.

They need to understand probabilities and the concept of risk management. They should know that it is risky to be in a public place, but that this risk is manageable with good social and hygiene practices. They also need to know that the virus is not the Black Death and not Ebola. The situation is serious, but our world is inherently dirty, that is why we have an immune system, and a single lapse \(a touch of the face, forgetting to wash hands, going shopping\) is not an immediate death sentence and no reason to panic or take drastic action. It is just a good lesson not to do it again. Actually, there are no reasons to panic at all - you must convince people that the best way to approach this is a rational approach to risk management. They should understand what behaviour is riskiest and what is safest, they must learn how to properly manage those risks.

## Underlying mental health issues

Please take special care to understand that there are likely to be people at the institute \(possibly your lab\) that have an underlying mental health issue. Please utilize our campus psychologist, be aware of what to do if these individuals go through a mental health crisis \(know the relevant emergency phone numbers\) and become aware of what to do under various circumstances. Encourage your lab members to contact the psychologist for a consultation if they are starting to get overwhelmed with the situation, with a positive diagnosis or with being under quarantine \(especially a long one\). Understand, that in a relatively short period of time the health services may be so stretched out that they may not be able to offer timely intervention. Make sure that you are conscious that a crisis may happen to one of your students and think about whom you can ask for help among your own social network in such a situation. That will help you maintain control of your own state of mind if that happens.

We know that your communities may be feeling anxious, stressed or frightened. Here are some important things to take into account and share with your community members:

* It’s normal to feel sad, stressed, confused, scared or angry during a crisis. Talking to people you trust can help, like friends, family or your fellow community members.
* If you must stay at home, maintain a healthy lifestyle, including proper diet, sleep, exercise. Keep up with loved ones at home by email and phone and connect with your larger Facebook community for support.
* Don’t use smoking, alcohol or other drugs to deal with your emotions.
* If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counselor. Have a plan on where to go to and how to seek help for physical and mental health needs if required.
* Get the facts. Gather information that will help you accurately determine your risk so that you can take reasonable precautions. Find a credible source you can trust such as the WHO website or a local or state public health agency.
