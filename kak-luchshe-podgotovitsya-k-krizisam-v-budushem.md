* [Ending Pandemics](https://endingpandemics.org/) is an organization dedicated to the early discovery of infectious disease outbreaks so they can be halted before they become pandemics. **Key takeaway:** “If we prioritize our efforts to find outbreaks faster in animals, it is possible to prevent human infection altogether.”
* In a world of uncertainty, only one thing is certain: shocks, disruptions, and other unsettling events will occur, and they will be novel and surprising. IFTF executive director Marina Gorbis argues in her essay [“The Future as a Way of Life,”](https://medium.com/@mgorbis/the-future-as-a-way-of-life-4bc314ec97de) that the only way to effectively deal with black swan events is through a “massively public endeavor” to envision and make the future. **Key takeaway:** “futures thinking is an essential 21st century skill: we need to cultivate it widely in everything we do.”
* Now, more than ever, it’s time to unstick your mind. “To avoid being blindsided by the future, you must develop mental habits of actively challenging what you believe could or could not be different,” writes IFTF’s Jane McGonigal in her essay, [“Counterfactual Thinking Is the Key to Creativity — and a Vaccine against Future Shock.”](https://medium.com/institute-for-the-future/counterfactual-thinking-is-the-key-to-creativity-and-a-vaccine-against-future-shock-9774a111b996) **Key takeaway:** “to invent something new, or make any kind of change in your society, you first have to be able to imagine how things can be different.”
