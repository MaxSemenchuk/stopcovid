## **What are the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic?**

* [Venture capitalist Azeem Azhar discusses six ways coronavirus will change our world](https://www.exponentialview.co/p/-six-ways-coronavirus-will-change). His list includes: open-sourcing formerly proprietary information about global threats, and a rise in online learning, working, and convening. **Key takeaway:** prepare for a shift from fragile global supply chains to “networked, decentralized and resilient” models.
* “Governments around the world may see this health crisis as an opportunity to introduce or implement controversial technology and systems for surveillance,” according to this [Access Now report](https://www.accessnow.org/protect-digital-rights-promote-public-health-towards-a-better-coronavirus-response/). **Key takeaway:** the outbreak is an opportunity “to assess how we can protect public health in the digital age, and where our digital rights fit into the global humanitarian response.”
* Building systems that are resilient to the global effects of pandemics could have far-reaching benefits. This 2010 paper published in the journal Influenza and [Other Respiratory Viruses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941659/) lists eight social benefits gained from developing effective response mechanisms to pandemics. **Key takeaway:** there are many “potential collateral benefits from pandemic planning and preparations that can be realized regardless of a future pandemic occurring.” ****
