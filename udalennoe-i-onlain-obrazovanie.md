## **For students \(guidelines\)**

#### Before the session:

* Check your connection, software and hardware before the call. Do a test call. Close any heavy bandwidth usage programs \(netflix, youtube\) on your network \(check with housemates\)
* Share materials you want to present before the call if possible

#### During the session

* Mute when you are not speaking
* Follow the Radio principles: Think - Unmute - Speak - Mute - Listen
* Use the chat option wisely, for example for numbers, links, interrupting\ \(i.e. ‘raising your hand’\), questions etc.
