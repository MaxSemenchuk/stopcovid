# \#StopCovid ua Report

![](../../.gitbook/assets/group-2-4-.png)

### What was the project’s problem statement?

Fighting COVID pandemy became a cruicial challenge to the world and country. Working on it required the best possible collaboration, which wasn't possible due to

* lack of trust and connection between the private & public sector
* distorted information flows and mixed public attitude
* overlap in the same work done by many groups simultaneously 
* a bunch of self-proclaimed coordination centers emerged, that weren't in contact between each other
* some region didn't even have visible coordination centers

### What was the project’s proposed solution?

Through the effort of volunteers from the creative economy, we created an open coordination center "Stop Covid ua". It relied on similar practices from the analogical global movement like endcoronavirus.org to open up all available information on coronavirus, planned or working projects and coordination mechanisms as focused calls on identified problems.

The ecosystem relied on

* public wiki
* telegram and discord chats to check and exchange info
* public spreadsheets and registers 

### Who was the target audience?

* Medical Staff
* Elder people
* Creative Volunteers \(entrepreneurs, marketers, translators, phycologists etc\)
* NGOs
* Businesses
* Citizens
