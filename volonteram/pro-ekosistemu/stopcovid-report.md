# \#StopCovid ua Report

![](../../.gitbook/assets/group-2-4-.png)

### What was the project’s problem statement?

Fighting COVID pandemy became a cruicial challenge to the world and our country. Solving on it required the best possible collaboration, which wasn't there due to

* lack of trust and connection between the private & public sector
* distorted information flows and mixed public attitude
* overlap in the same work done by many groups simultaneously 
* a bunch of coordination centers emerged, that weren't in contact between each other
* some region didn't even had visible coordination centers

### What was the project’s proposed solution?

Through the effort of volunteers from the creative economy, we created an open coordination center "StopCovid UA". It relied on similar practices from the analogical global movements like endcoronavirus.org to open up all available information on coronavirus, planned or maintained projects and transparent coordination mechanisms around identified problems.

The ecosystem relied on

* public wiki
* website and various social media 
* telegram and discord chats
* public registries
* regular open conference calls
* informal community practices

### Who was the target audience?

* Medical staff & hospitals
* Elder people and other vulnerable groups
* Creative volunteers \(entrepreneurs, marketers, translators, phycologists etc\)
* NGOs
* Businesses
* Citizens

### Around when did the project start? About how long did it last?
