## **Remote work advice**

1. If you've been commuting, keep a percentage of your commute cost for "nice things" at work - whether that's a great lamp for your desk, an image you love in a frame, some plants or a set of 20 Sharpies in different colours. Put the rest of the money into your savings if you don‚Äôt need to use it for other essential costs.
2. The presenters on Radio 5 Live \(or your station of choice\) are a big part of your life but they are not actually your real friends. Talk to some real people each day as well as the radio/the cat/the dog.
3. Routine! Get up, wash your face, stretch. Be sure to set times around to stretch, do a little exercise, drink water, eat nourishing foods, and when to turn all the tech off. ‚ÄúI am only working from 8-4, an hour for lunch, and 4 mini-breaks for stretching and water.‚Äù

### Notes on hosting virtual meetings

Note: Where possible use voice only for conference calls \(with a profile pic\) as it‚Äôll improve call quality by reducing the bandwidth required for the call.
